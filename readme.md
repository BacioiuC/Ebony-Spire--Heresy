Ebony Spire: Heresy
================================

**ES:Heresy** is a **first person roguelike** in which the player (a **berserker**, **night shade** or **scroll mage**) invades the *sacred tower* of *Dae'eria*, the *Ebony Spire*, in an attempt to slay the fervent goddess! The player has to climb up all 10 tower levels to reach the most sacred of places. Each floor contains one or more portals to other realms that the player must visit in order to obtain equipment that can aid him in his quest.

**ES:H** is played from a first person perspective. You can move around using W, A, S, D and look/turn around with Q and E. Inventory can be accessed using the I key. You can pick up items with P, equip them with Space (from the inventory) or throw them using the T key. **Gameplay revolves around acquiring items and using them to defeat enemies you encounter. **
